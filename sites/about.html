                Nothing allows you to get to know another person as meeting and talking with them in person, 
                but before you decide to contact me, get to know me as I describe myself. I have chosen several 
                important traits that I believe characterize me well, and at the same time, I can bring a lot of quality to your company or team.

                Soft skills are becoming increasingly important in today's changing market. The ability to communicate with people is now 
                a fundamental asset in everyday work. I have developed my skills through several years of work in the sales segment, 
                maintaining daily contact with customers and the management team. Additionally, after being promoted to a manager position, 
                working with a team, developing employees, and conducting recruitment interviews have allowed me to advance further.

                Teamwork is an essential element when working on commercial projects or within larger enterprises. 
                Finding one's place in a team, recognizing opportunities and team risks significantly influences work effectiveness. 
                I am confident that while working on individual and team results, I have contributed to the development of people around me. 
                I enjoy seeing myself as a leader, with aspirations to be an inspiring leader. I have worked in circumstances where we 
                collectively fought to achieve set goals, and I have led the sales team as a sales manager.

                Hard skills, undoubtedly, form the foundation of a programmer's work. The entry barrier is currently 
                quite high for a novice junior, which is why I strive to engage with as many technologies as possible 
                during my learning process to become proficient. I have chosen Python as my primary language because I 
                appreciate its simple solutions that can be applied to more complex problems. Although I have worked 
                with C/C++ during courses, I found Python more appealing due to its lower complexity level and need for 
                control. Additionally, Git, GitHub, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, basic networking, computer science fundamentals, 
                hardware/software knowledge - all are essential in IT work, and I have approached each of these topics with dedication.

                Over the past few years of my life, I have dedicated myself primarily to personal development. 
                I must admit that learning new topics and delving into familiar ones has become my way of life. 
                I love discovering new solutions, acquiring new knowledge, and applying it all in practice. 
                One example is this website and my desire to switch industries to one that has interested me for a long time - IT. Additionally, 
                I indulge in books and audiobooks about historical figures, developing new skills, historical films, commentary, and informative content. 
                Moreover, I listen to podcasts featuring conversations with interesting people, finance, geopolitics, politics, and science. 
                I devote practically all my free time to these activities because knowledge is simply the key to power.

                conducting recruitment interviews, knowledge of labor law, electronic and paper document administration, project management, and implementation. 
                I have experience in task allocation and monitoring using JIRA. I have also worked with SAP ERP and CRM systems, 
                dealing with reports, deliveries, orders, stock management, and inventory. Furthermore, I have been involved in inventory creation, 
                execution, and reconciliation.
