                    My wife did a small photo session of me and I edited those photos in Gimp. I added some text, changed colours and removed background. 
                    I will use them on the page. I saw one problem, its looking good on my Mac but on mobile its not looking correct. 
                    When I finish main page I will take care of mobile version.

                    I did first version of my page. It will be rather simple but I will try keep it estetic. I will track progress in another file. For now I will focus mainly on HTML/CSS. 
                    I have installed Firebase on my Mac. Firebase will be a hosting and backend for my page. 
                    Managing it in Terminal is quite simple and it allows my to run local hosting and even access webpage on different devices connected to WIFI. 
                    Most knowledge I take from www.3wschools.com.

                I did a remind of HTML/CSS and I learned a few simple functions and commands as addEventListener, querySelector from JavaScript. 
                I finished a course of creating a web pages few years ago but its good to refresh knowledge. 
                As a project I have to do a full web page and its a good coincidence because I wanted to do so anyway and post there my diary updates and my projects. 
                So Im gonna do it with HTML and CSS and I will add some JS although, it would be probably pretty simple.

            Now I have mastered SQL basics, I can search for data, sort it, join tables, rows and columns. 
            For beginning I thinks its enough but later I think getting more deeper into sql would be nice. As a proof of my development I send a few projects on my GitHub.
            I will start HTML/CSS/JS now nad my goal is to build a free website where I could post my diary entries and document my development and projects.

            Today I also created a file called literatura.pages where I will keep a list of books I have listened to or read with short, 
            most important, things to remember or what it was about so I can later remind it to myself. Also, today I received books I have ordered about programming, 
            about clear code (Czysty Kod. Robert C. Martin), pragmatic programmer (Pragmatyczny programista. David Thomas, Andrew Hunt) and python (Python. Eric Matthes). 
            I will start with python and later I will take care about the rest.

                        I finishes lectures about SQL and by now I did few problem sets from cs50. Finally using databases in Python is something that really I’m interested in. 
                        I need to do it more as I used only few syntaxes in operations with sqlite3 in Python. Syntax from sqlite3 is quite easy itself. 
                        Later I would like to get closer look to MySQL as it’s probably more complex. But basics of SQL I think are quite good. Time for practice. 
                        All syntax and ideas from SQL I wrote to a file dictionary.pages where I keep all useful information.
