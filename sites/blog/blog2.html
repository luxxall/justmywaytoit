                    Most of side websites are ready. Need last touch to finish them. What Ia have learned while making this website is so important to me. 
                    I managed to create my website with HTML and CSS. I used some bootstrap templates. I created a contact formula with working mailing. 
                    I use Git and GitHub to backup my project and be up to date with changes. I try to use terminal build in VSC only. 
                    Sometimes of course its more convenient for me to use standard, graphical, way but I try to use terminal as much as its possible. 
                    Additionally, I use Firebase to host my page and to manage it. To test my page I have to use localhost, local hosting and share it with local devices on my local wifi. 
                    My website has to fit different screen sizes so I have adopted it to do so. Those are very important things to me. 
                    It takes time to do everything but I want to do it right way so I keep moving forward.

                    I finished redesigning my website. It’s much more modern and clean now. For now I have main page and contact page ready. 
                    Still 3 to go. I’m so better now in html css. I’m doing things more fluently, it comes much easier for me to understand what’s going on. 
                    Thanks to that mobile support is a way better because Im doing things more harmonic.

                    Update to post above. Contact form email sending works great, it was slow because of some server problems on their site, but now its doing really good. 
                    Moreover, I started to use GIT. I used GitHub earlier but now I would like to use a common tool among programmers so I watched a tutorial about GIT. 
                    I wrote commands to my blog file. I will now update my page to GitHub via GIT bash commands to keep it up to date and become more familiar with GIT and GitHub.
                    PS. I will probably redesign my website, because I have found some inspiration on TikTok I think.

                I did a Contact tab on my website. Unfortunately, I had problems with making my contact form working correct. At first I have found a PHP solution, 
                I wrote (with help from Internet because I don’t know php yet) a PHP file to send email from page to my mail. 
                But it occurred that when I want to send email the PHP file is downloaded instead of do what it should. 
                I found something about PHP support on Firebase and I started to search for a solution but it seemed to be rather hard to do. So I was looking for another way to do this. 
                I found a tutorial on YT using Firebase realtime database and JS file to initiate it. I have wrote this file (again with help from YT) but and the end, 
                this didn’t work the way I expected. Data was collected on Firebase database but emails weren’t send on my email box. So I was looking for something else. 
                Finally I have found a website formsubmit.co and it was it. First I tried to go with YT tutorial and post my website on Git and manage it from there, 
                but I have found doing it with Firebase more comfortable for me. So I added just simple attributes to my main HTML file, activated formsubmit, 
                deployed all to Firebase and its working perfectly now. Only problem with this site is that is pretty slow, but its free so I can’t explain for now.

            I needed to edit some images and invert their colours from black to white. I couldn’t find them with already correct colours in the internet 
            as well as I couldn’t find a proper online tool to do it. So I wrote a Python program myself to do that for me. 
            I have found a great library Image and it gives a function of colour inverting. I just had to find some more code on the internet 
            because some of PNGs or JPGs were in RGBA or something like that system so my program didn’t work all the time 
            but when I added this functionality I works great and I can now use images I like.

            Today I discovered @media screen CSS command. Its great because I can change proportions and values of my classes and DIs to resize them to mobile version. 
            Finally its starting to look good also on iPhone.
