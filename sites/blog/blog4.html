                        I found a YT channel that inspired me to order a TP-Link router and USB network card. 
                        A man is learning programming from the very beginning just as me but hes more into networking and cybersecurity. 
                        But hes learning about network and I have heard that basis of this are also important for everyone in IT. 
                        So after finishing CS50 probably my next goal will be to learn basis of network.

                    Diagram helped me one more time. I finished another project in Python and at first this project overwhelmed me but
                    slowly I started to divide it to smaller pieces and draw a diagram how program should like like in steps. 
                    I had to spend some time to think about it and project it but after I finished, work really was super easier.
                    Thanks to that I finished first big program in Python that really involved almost all I had to use before. Working with files, 
                    conditions, checking for CLA, loops and more. I can see already how faster I’m able now to write code, but its so ugly right now xd, but I really can see the progress.

                Diagrams of project and mental work before even writing a single line of code makes a difference. I downloaded Flowchart Designer 3, 
                because its free, and now I will draw there a sketch for my project. That’s one of ways to help me organise my work and work faster.

                I started using AI (chatGPT) to improve my code. I don’t use it to generate code but when I’m done with writing it myself
                 I ask for advices how to make my code more efficient or better looking. It is so helpful. When I can’t repair my code, 
                 after trying and trying I ask AI to help me with it too and it really does. I asked it for some tips about how to prepare to make a project, 
                 because I feel like that’s really thing that blocks me on finishing my project faster, and chat gave me some really good tips like, 
                 pseudo-code, make diagram of a project, test before writing a code etc. And it really make my work more organised.

                Time for Python. I started with rewriting few projects that previously I did in C, now in Python. 
                It occurs that some of them are way easier because of functions that already implemented in Python and thanks to them code gets smaller. 
                Syntax I more human-like. And it bases on indentations in the text. It’s a bit confusing at the beginning but gets easier on the way.

                The time for data structures (lists of pointers in C) has come. Data structure is a term for describing a datas that are storage in memory and are not side by side (as arrays do). 
                It means that we have to add an additional little space to every data and this special space would be used to point to address of another data that we want to keep in the list. 
                This means that in one adres in memory we storage data itself and bounded address to this is a pointer that points to next address etc. 
                Last item of our list keep a NULL value in metadata (that what’s this special additional place called) to let the program know that its end of the list. 
                To start the whole process of listing and pointing we need one additional piece in memory that keep an address of a first element of my list. 
                When this „start“ pointer is being used and the process starts.
