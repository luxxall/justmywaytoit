                        So, here I am after a break because of moving out from Poland to Germany (we had to move all of our stuff and set up and renovate our nowe flat). 
                        I started to analyse a structure of a JPG file, this is essential to start with the task I’m going to do. 
                        First three bytes of a JPG file are always <span class="contentTxt">0xff 0xd8 0xff</span> from left to right. Fourth byte would be <span class="contentTxt">0xe0, 0xe1, 0xe2, 0xe3, 0xe4, 0xe5, 0xe6, 0xe7, 0xe8, 0xe9, 0xea, 0xeb, 0xec, 0xed, 0xee, or 0xef.</span>
                        Put another way, the fourth byte’s first four bits are <span class="contentTxt">1110.</span> If I make a photo and it’s written on a memory card the files are immediately storage one after another. 
                        And mentioned before pattern of bytes indicates end of a file and start of next one. However, cards are often initialised with FAT system which uses 512 bit blocks. 
                        A photo that is 1 MB (1,048,576 B) takes up 1,048,576 B / 512 = 2048 blocks. But so does a photo that’s, say, one byte smaller (i.e., 1,048,575 B)! The wasted space on disk is called “slack space.”. 
                        If i want to recover a photos that were deleted by someone I can write a program that iterates over the memory card in those FAT indicated blocks and search for a JPG indicating byte series. 
                        When I find that sequence I can rewrite a byte structure to a new file and that will so to say recover a deleted (forgotten) file. 
                    </p>

                    I started working on Recovery task. I had to choose between Recovery - that could recover a file that was deleted by a mistake from pendrive 
                    - and Reverse - that reverses an audio file, using back masking - I really feel that Recovery might my more useful in the future and I have chosen that task. 
                    The program doesn’t have any helpers so I need to design it from 0. This is very exciting and I wonder how long it take to write that kind of program by myself.

                I finished FIlter task. I have learned how apply filters on images just by coding, without using any other apps. 
                This is so usable and valuable information that could be useful in the future. Working on files, 
                images and sound files makes feeling of working on something that really exists in IT and not only solving some programming problems 
                that won’t matter in real work.

                Information written in files. Those are headers in the beginning of a file that contains information about the file itself. 
                For example for images its first 44 bytes that contains images heigh, width, resolution etc. Sound files also have a header. 
                <br>WAV files:<br>-first 44 bytes contains information about: size of file, number of samples per second, size of each sample. 
                next are samples, each 2 bytes (16 bits) representing audio signal in specific time till the end of file. Multiplying this samples changes volume of a file.
                <br>Images BMP (bitmap):
                two header firs BITMAPFILEHEADER (contains info about type, size and layout) is 14 bytes (1 byte is 8 bits) long and second is 40 bytes (1 byte is 8 bits) long 
                BITMAPINFOHEADER (contains info about width, height, planes, bit count, pixelpermeter, compression). More info in files description.
                After that is actual image, that is an array of pixels[columns][rows] represented by triples of RGB colours. Colour of each pixel is determined by number of each
                 - Red or Green or Blue colour. 0 is lowest and 255 is highest. When triple is all 0 then pixels is black, when 255 its white. (If I have R-255, G-0, B-0, the pixel is red). 
                 Important thing is that in BITMAP triples are inverted. They are represented by BGR in that order. 
                <br>FILTERS:<br>
                Sepia (that sets new values to Red, Green and Blue pixel by multiplying original colours by specific values. There are a couple of algorithms that describes sepia effect).
                <br>Reflected image left to right (it just changes the position of a pixel from left to right. Ex, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and in reflected image pixels are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).
                <br>Reflected bottom up (if I want to reflect the image horizontally, then the value of hight in HEADERINFO needs to be minus).
                <br>Grayscale (In that case we count average value of Red, Green and Blue in each pixel and set this value as a new value).
                <br>Blur (Blur takes a grid of pixels that surrounds each pixel and counts its average colour and after that sets this average as a new value to a pixel).

                So it’s time to take memory allocation into consideration. Now I start the topic why we are using C in CS50 course. It’s a low lover programming language, 
                that means I have access to allocating values into a specific location in memory. I can sign into that memory specific size and type. 
                This is essential when efficiency matters. Next thing is about working with files. How to open, edit and write information from file. 
                That open new horizons for edition sound files, images and a lot more. This is connected with memory allocation because when for example copying data from one file to another memory allocation occurs.
