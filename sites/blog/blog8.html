                    Noticed today few books that were strongly recommended to read. They are about programming and self development. 
                    When I complete listening to audiobook about negotiations which I’m listening to now I will start them.

                        SPOJ<br>
                        Stopped my game development<br>
                        I discovered a website SPOJ which contains exercises for programmer to test their skills. Tried to do first task but I failed. 
                        I had problem with understanding meaning of the problem in that case. Stopped to develop the game. I think it’s pointless when 
                        I’m looking for some code on the Internet to do particular thing in my game and then I just rewrite it. I want to learn to write those elements by myself and to understand of how its made. 
                        I really want to be a part of IT and to do that I have to learn and learn and learn to be good at programming, to understand what I’m doing, to have knowledge, to have a portfolio, make some apps. 
                        I really enjoy coding and I hope not to loose this fire.

                    I want to code games<br>
                    Adventure Game 3000 - console adventure game<br>
                    I want to code games. I like playing games and this looks like the direction I want  to go. I’ve found some tutorial on YT how to create console adventure game and 
                    I tried to make something similar. I’ve wrote a bit of code and the game is very simple but its running. As far as I go it feels like the code is so chaotic and 
                    I feel like it should be done in some other way because it gets so long but I don’t know how to overcome this.

                Podcast „Porozmawiajmy o IT”<br>
                I started to listen to podcast about IT - Porozmawiajmy o IT,  hosted by experienced programmer, he’s talking with his guests who are also IT people and topics 
                of their conversations are about changing work to IT, how to learn programming, what is the best way to find first job in IT.

                I started to learn C++<br>
                Kurs C++, Pasja Informatyki, Mirosław Zelent<br>
                First steps I’ve made were to watch an online tutorial on YouTube from Mirosław Zelent on Pasja Informatyki channel. It’s a free playlist that explains basis of 
                C++ and makes this first knowledge about C++ to develop. Why I started C++? I wanted to learn JavaScript but on the first episode on the tutorial on YT I 
                heard that before I start to learn JavaScript I should knew some basis of C++ because it will make it easier. When I started C++ tutorial I continuatded to learn 
                this language as I heard that most of games are programmed in this language.
