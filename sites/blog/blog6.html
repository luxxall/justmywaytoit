                        So I finished Runoff. I had a lot of troubles because of not working debugging so everything I had to write and check myself. 
                        But It was very important at the very beginning to understand an idea of how progam should work. Also two demential arrays which I had to use in 
                        loop in loop to search for specific value with specific status were a bit problematic in sense of logical thinking about them. 
                        Overall code wasn’t hard itself but the whole idea was and testing each of programs functions.

            <div class="title appear2">

                        Finally I did some progress in Runoff program. Debug isn’t working so I have to manually write code and check step by step how the program is going. 
                        It’s rather slow but that’s what I must do. I managed to write 3 functions and there are 3 left. Using two demential array I looped through data to 
                        sign values to candidates that are not eliminated, using if statement. The funny fact is that I might did it correctly a week ago but 
                        I didn’t  check that in correct way so I thought that its bad :< Only few steps left, sorting to find the minimum and than eliminating candidates by 
                        deleting or rather changing status of a struct to skip them in loops.

                    Problem sets are now harder. I managed to do Plurality and Snackbar tasks but those weren’t that hard. The real thing starts now, I have to do two bigger taks that are 
                    abut ballots and voting for candidates. The biggest problem for me is to understand the way that program should work and to plan actions. Writing code is a 
                    later phase of making a program. Anyway, I have to finally start writing this programs, because there are a tiny slowdowns on my way to it due to my 
                    wedding and preparations around it. But I have to continue.

                I was wrong. I thought that bubble sort is slower than selecting sort, but in CS50 task where I had to recognise which sorting method is used to 
                sort a few files with random numbers, I saw that bubble sort is in fact faster in already sorted data than selection sort. Merge sort is the winner in all kind of data.

                            I completed 3 easy sorting tasks. Sorting isn’t that hard but for now I’m using only few sorting methods. Bubble sort, selection sort and merge sort. 
                            Merge sort is the most advanced sorting method I know. It divides the data into smaller groups and sorts these smaller groups by dividing them even more. 
                            When it comes to point that divided group contains only 1 value then its compared to to a little bigger group and this comparison means that the values are set in correct order. 
                            Later another data group is sorted in the same way as before. That makes the sorting faster but it takes a lot of memory because of all the comparisons and dividing that algorithm takes. 
                            Bobble sort and selection sorty are better for smaller data bases. Bubble sort compares two values that are side by side and puts them in correct order. 
                            Algorithm runs a number of times switching values and the data is considered sorted when no switches left, that means all values are in correct order. 
                            Select sort runs through data base and looks for the smallest value and puts it in first place, then it runs again looking for another smaller value that left in 
                            the data base and when its found its settled in correct order. When all values are settled into correct place the data base I considered to be sorted.
