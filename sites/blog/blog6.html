                        So I finished Runoff. I had a lot of troubles because of not working debugging so everything I had to write and check myself. 
                        But It was very important at the very beginning to understand an idea of how progam should work. Also two demential arrays which I had to use in 
                        loop in loop to search for specific value with specific status were a bit problematic in sense of logical thinking about them. 
                        Overall code wasn’t hard itself but the whole idea was and testing each of programs functions.

                        Today I’ve received an email with an information that Harvard’s SQL course, which I signed into few weeks ago, 
                        is running at the evening. I participated and it was first time I did something with SQL. It was just an introduction but there will be more classes which I will take part. 
                        First impression is that it was pretty clear to use and reminded me about programming in style of writing, but will see in the future.

                    Now it’s time to start with sorting and searching in C. I’ve heard about linear search and bubble search but as I can see 
                    CS50 is taking into consideration more than that, so I’m curious about this.

                Finally after some troubles I made program called substitution for CS50. Beginnings were really tough. Surprisingly 
                I didn’t have much problems with writing the code but thing that was holding me was to work in organised way. 
                I didn’t write down step by step how to make my program to work, instead I just started writing it but I get frustrated every time it didn’t work. 
                After that I checked on CS50 page what’s is TODO in which order and that made my work organised I was able to finish the program. 
                This shows me that I must pay bigger attention to think about how to work, how to organise my work and maybe write down milestones for my program 
                and steps that should be made to complete the task. Next time I will take more time to think about the project and make a TODO list.

                My first a little more advanced program! 250+ lines of code. Harvards problem set 1!
                Im so glad that I started Harvard’s course. Their practice tasks are so well prepared. They are pretty hard but not that hard I can’t do them. 
                Its great that they are more complex and it demands to use more planning and thinking about whole project. This is key word for me. A project. 
                SPOJ taks are just simple programs but demanding more thinking about logical attendance to the problem. Harvard’s tasks take longer time to do them. 
                I had to use more knowledge I have and use it in practice. Its very satisfying doing those things. Every task is decided into simple and more complex taks and I have to do one of them. 
                But I always start with more complex one and finally I do them both. This is maybe like just a 5 % of a real project in a company but for a start it is something. I can’t wait to do and beat more tasks.
